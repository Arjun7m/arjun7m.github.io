I am a [Master's student](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/people/students/choudhry-arjun.html) at the [Language Technologies Institute](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I conduct research at the [Auton Lab](https://autonlab.org/) at the [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/) under the guidance of [Prof. Artur Dubrawski](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/artur-w-dubrawski/).

My research focuses on pushing the boundaries of foundation models beyond just text and image modalities. I am particularly interested in:

* Developing pragmatic multimodal foundation models that can jointly model time series data with text or image data
* Creating efficient inference methods for large-scale foundation models for deployment in edge devices
* Designing comprehensive evaluation frameworks and benchmarks for analyzing systemic design flaws in current state-of-the-art approaches

Through the above three research directions, my goal is to create pragmatic, efficient, multimodal models for domain-specific applications, with a focus on healthcare.

Before joining CMU as a Master's Student in Fall 2023, I was a Visiting Research Intern (Remote) at the [Auton Lab](https://autonlab.org/) under the mentorship of [Mononito Goswami](https://mononitogoswami.github.io/) and [Prof. Artur Dubrawski](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/artur-w-dubrawski/). I worked on benchmarking efforts for label quality assessment approaches. Prior to that, I was a Research Fellow at the [Australian Artificial Intelligence Institute (AAII)](https://www.uts.edu.au/research/australian-artificial-intelligence-institute) at [University of Technology Sydney](https://www.uts.edu.au/) and a Research Associate & Lead at the [Biometric Research Laboratory](https://www.dtu.ac.in/Web/Departments/InformationTechnology/lab_and_infra/bml/index.php) at [Delhi Technological University](https://dtu.ac.in/), jointly advised by [Prof. Mukesh Prasad](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Mukesh.Prasad/about) and [Prof. Dinesh Kumar Vishwakarma](https://sites.google.com/dtu.ac.in/dkv/home), working on adversarial models using emotional signals to effectively detect fake news on social media. I also worked on efficient approaches for influence maximization on social networks using heuristic and meta-heuristic approaches. I was also a Research Intern at [Université du Québec à Montréal](https://uqam.ca/) under [Prof. Marie-Jean Meurs](https://www.mjmrsc.com/index.html), working on adversarial adaptation of language models using external unlabeled corpora for applications in Named Entity Recognition.

I earned my Bachelor's in Information Technology from [Delhi Technological University](https://dtu.ac.in/) (erstwhile Delhi College of Engineering) in India, graduating top 2% in my department and top 0.5% in the university. I was advised by [Prof. Dinesh Kumar Vishwakarma](https://sites.google.com/dtu.ac.in/dkv/home) at the [Biometric Research Laboratory](https://www.dtu.ac.in/Web/Departments/InformationTechnology/lab_and_infra/bml/index.php), [Prof. Seba Susan](https://www.dtu.ac.in/Web/Departments/InformationTechnology/faculty/sebasusanrajan.php), and [Prof. Minni Jain](https://dtu.ac.in/modules/facilities/people/faculty/view.php?uname=minnijain). I was fortunate to be selected as a [MITACS Globalink Research Intern](https://www.mitacs.ca/our-programs/globalink-research-internship-students/) in Summer 2021 at [Université du Québec à Montréal](https://uqam.ca/), advised by [Prof. Marie-Jean Meurs](https://www.mjmrsc.com/index.html), where I worked on large-scale benchmarking of multilingual language models for downstream applications in Named Entity Recognition.

Feel free to drop me an email at arjuncho [at] andrew [dot] cmu [dot] edu if you are interested in my research and would like to collaborate!

I am looking for Ph.D. positions for Fall 2025. If you feel I am a good fit for your lab, please feel free to reach out. I would love to connect! :)
