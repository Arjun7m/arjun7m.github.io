I am a Master's student at Carnegie Mellon University's Language Technologies Institute. I conduct research at the Auton Lab at the School of Computer Science under the guidance of Professor Artur Dubrawski.

My research focuses on pushing the boundaries of foundation models beyond just text and image modalities. I am particularly interested in:

* Developing pragmatic multimodal foundation models that can jointly model time series data with text or image data
* Creating efficient inference methods for large-scale foundation models for deployment in edge devices
* Designing comprehensive evaluation frameworks and benchmarks for analyzing systemic design flaws in current state-of-the-art approaches

Through the above three research directions, my goal is to create pragmatic, efficient, multimodal models for domain-specific applications, with a focus on healthcare.

Before joining CMU as a Master's Student in Fall 2023, I was a Visiting Research Intern (Remote) at the Auton Lab under the mentorship of Mononito Goswami and Prof. Artur Dubrawski. I worked on benchmarking efforts for label quality assessment approaches. Prior to that, I was a Research Fellow at the University of Technology Sydney and a Research Lead at the Bimetric Research Laboratory at Delhi Technological University, jointly advised by Prof. Mukesh Prasad and Prof. Dinesh Kumar Vishwakarma, working on adversarial models using emotional signals to effectively detect fake news on social media. I also worked on efficient approaches for influence maximization on social networks using heuristic and meta-heuristic approaches. I was also a Research Intern at Université du Québec à Montréal under Prof. Marie-Jean Meurs, working on adversarial adaptation of language models using external unlabeled corpora for applications in Named Entity Recognition.

I earned my Bachelor's in Information Technology from Delhi Technological University (erstwhile Delhi College of Engineering) in India, graduating top 2% in my department and top 0.5% in the university. I was advised by Prof. Dinesh Kumar Vishwakarma at the Biometric Research Laboratory, Prof. Seba Susan, and Prof. Minni Jain. I was fortunate to be selected as a MITACS Globalink Research Intern in 2021 at Université du Québec à Montréal, advised by Prof. Marie-Jean Meurs, where I worked on large-scale benchmarking of multilingual language models for downstream applications in Named Entity Recognition.

Feel free to drop me an email at arjuncho [at] andrew [dot] cmu [dot] edu if you are interested in my research and would like to collaborate!

I am looking for Ph.D. positions for Fall 2025. If you feel I am a good fit for your lab, please feel free to reach out. I would love to connect! :)
